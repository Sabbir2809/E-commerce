# E-commerce

Our goal is to build an e-commerce platform that will allow users to buy and sell products. The platform should be built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) and should be completed within 1 month.

1. **Features and Functionality: The platform should have the following features and functionality:**

   - **User Registration and Login:** Users should be able to register for an account and log in to the platform using their email address or social media account. The registration process should include validation to ensure that the user has entered valid information. Users should also be able to reset their password if they forget it.

   - **Product Listings:** Users should be able to browse and search for products listed on the platform. The product listings should include information such as the product name, description, price, and images. Users should be able to filter and sort the product listings based on various criteria, such as price, popularity, and category.

   - **Shopping Cart:** Users should be able to add products to their cart and view their cart before making a purchase. The shopping cart should display the products that the user has added, along with the total cost and any applicable taxes or shipping fees.

   - **Payments:** Users should be able to pay for products using a payment gateway, such as PayPal or Stripe. The payment gateway should be integrated with the platform and should provide a secure and seamless checkout experience.

   - **Reviews and Ratings:** Users should be able to leave reviews and ratings for products. The reviews and ratings should be displayed on the product listing page and should be used to help other users make informed purchasing decisions.

   - **Seller Dashboard:** Sellers should have access to a dashboard where they can manage their product listings, view sales and earnings, and respond to customer inquiries. The seller dashboard should include features such as the ability to add and edit product listings, view order history, and track earnings.

   - **Admin Panel:** Admins should have access to an admin panel where they can manage users, products, payments, and other site settings. The admin panel should include features such as the ability to view and edit user accounts, manage product listings, process payments, and configure site settings.

   - **Order Management:** Admins should be able to manage orders, including viewing orders, marking orders as shipped, and issuing refunds. The order management system should be integrated with the payment gateway and should provide real-time updates on order status.

1. **Technology Requirements: The platform should be built using the MERN stack, including:**

   - MongoDB for the database.
   - Express for the server-side framework.
   - React for the client-side framework.
   - Node.js for the server-side runtime environment.

1. **Other requirements:**

   - The platform should be responsive and mobile-friendly. It should be optimized for various screen sizes and should provide a seamless user experience across all devices.

   - The code should be well-documented and maintainable. The code should be organized and easy to understand, with comments and documentation where necessary.

   - The platform should be secure and include user authentication and authorization. User passwords should be encrypted and all sensitive data should be protected using industry-standard security protocols.

   - The platform should be deployed on a cloud-based platform such as AWS or Google Cloud. The deployment process should be automated and should include monitoring and logging to ensure the platform is always available and performing well.
